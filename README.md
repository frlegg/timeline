# Timeline
The earth's timeline on the template of Josh Worth's scale model of the solar system. Hosted [here](frlegg.github.io/timeline)

Nothing in this is 100% to scale. This is for a couple of reasons:
1. When 1 pixel is 1221 years, and its very easy tomiss by > 10 pixels, then there is a substansial error margin
2. Every date may be longer or shorter than what it is represented as because of the obvious impossibility of objectivity in studying the past of millions of years ago

## Usage
Don't actually bother scrolling through everything. Just use the arrows and placecards at the top.
The background color corresponds to a era or eon. The website itself will tell you more.
