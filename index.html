            <div id="hadean" class="essay l10n" style="left:0px">The earth’s first eon was the Hadean Eon (4.6ga - 4ga). In mind with what happened in this time, a geologist, Preston Cloud, fittingly named it after Hades, the greek god of the underworld.</div>
            <div id="as-it-turns" class="essay" style="left:20666px">As it turns out, things are pretty far apart.</div>
            <div id="the-background" class="essay" style="left:62000px">The background color of the page corresponds to what age it is in. The current one is Hadean. Its color is close to what it would’ve been like back then. Its based off an artists impression of what it would’ve looked like. The art can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hadean.png">here</a>. Looks pretty hot.</div>
            <div id="moon-creation" class="event" style="left:85000px"><span class="dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>Formation of the moon (roughly)</div>
            <div id="the-little-geological" class="essay" style="left:160000px">The little geological evidence we have for this period includes some rocks that have been carbon-dated at 4.1 ga after being found in Western Australia. Unfortunately, these are devestating to religious theories that assert the earth started only a few thousand years from present. How ironic that the existance of the “hellish age of earth” brought terror to the heaven of young-earth creationists.</div>
            <div id="it-is-also-thought" class="essay" style="left:330000px">It is also thought (despite this being the most hellish age of earth) that this was when water came to earth. Many people debate how, with theories including that some asteroids hit earth containing water, and even that hydrogen inside the earth might’ve helped create the oceans around the earth today. I personally think that the water tribes as described in Avatar brought water to the earth from anime heaven so humans could live on earth and thus start a pop-culture religious fan movement for Avatar.</div>

            <div id="archean" class="essay" style="left:487770px">The earth’s second eon is dubbed Archean (4ga-2.5ga) which comes from the Greek word αρχή (arkhē) which means beginning or origin. Of course, the geologists who named this period as such were not born at the right time to know about the Hadean Eon. Sad lol XD.</div>
            <div id="despite-the" class="essay" style="left: 590000px">Despite the etymology of the word implying goodness, creation, greenery, etc, the Archean period was still quite hellish like its last period as the Earth’s heat flow was 3 times higher than it is today. All this was basically a freebie of the planet accreation deal. </div>
            <div id="even-though" class="essay" style="left:815000px">Even though there were high heat rates, life can be confirmed to have been around the beginning of this era as in Western Greenland, graphite of biogenic origin was found dating aroud 3.7 ga. Pretty gnarly. Despite past life evidence being found, humans wouldn’t’ve been able to live on earth at this time because there was hardly any free oxygen. We basically would’ve just suffocated. </div>
            <div id="there-most-likely" class="essay" style="left:830000px">There most likely weren’t any eukaryotic cells around in this time either as we haven’t found any evidence for them. It is likely that there were prokaryotic life forms around though. </div>
            <div id="by the way" class="essay" style="left:1110000px">By the way, you might be interested in why the background color of the Archean Eon is grey. Its because according the artist’s impression of it (which can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Archean.png">here</a>) looks pretty grey, assumably because after all the magma cooled down it settled into dull rock. I wonder what Tasmania looked like back then.</div>
            <div id="photosynthesis" class="event" style="left:1138722px;"><span class="dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>Start of photosynthesis on earth</div>
            <div id="recently-theres" class="essay" style="left:1420000px">Recently there’s been some recent evidence that the earth would’ve been experiencing tons of oxygen fluctuation from the fact that according to Simone Marchi “[We] were probably being hit by a Chicxulub-sized impact on average every 15 million years” That would’ve given the earth some large scars (or small scrapes, depending on your perspective)</div>

            <div id="proterozoic" class="essay" style="left: 1709083px;">Welcome to the Proterozoic Eon, the last major section in the Pre-cambrian super-eon. The etymology of the word Proterozoic is “protero” (earlier, former) “zoic” (life) so it means earlier life. The next era is Paleozoic which means old life, so considering this period is even older it must be dead ancient.</div>
            <div id="great-oxidization" class="event" style="left:1789643px; color: black; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="width: 325000px; border-radius: 25px;" class=" black dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>The Great Oxidization Event - first eukaryotic cells </div>
            <div id="this-eon-saw" class="essay" style="left:2000000px">The oxidization process is still going. Remember, for the earth to still be holding all this oxygen in its lungs, it must've taken a very big breath. One that actually spans over 400 million years.</div>
            <div id="there-was-much" class="essay" style="left:2200000px">There was much continent building in this eon, with the earth transitioning from the supercontinent of Columba eventually to the supercontinent of Gondwana after millions of years of moving around. Basically, the earth’s tectonic plates were like an indecisive teenager not knowing how to arrange their room for a few million years.</div>
            <div id="another-significant" class="essay" style="left: 2500000px;">Another significant event that is hypothesised to have happened in this eon is the snowball earth glaciation. Its a theory that at one point in time in the Cryogenian period the earth managed to get such a large ice age that the entire earth froze over creating a snowball earth. The event is the inspiration behind the background color for this eon – white. </div>
            <div id="scientists-have-found" class="essay" style="left: 2800000px;">Scientists have found very old granite from this period which indicates that there was lot of subduction occuring in the Proterozoic eon.</div>
            <div id="in-terms-of-how-life" class="essay" style="left: 3000000px;">In terms of how life evolved in this period, we found evidence for preliminary eukaryotic cells from this eon. This could occur because the earth accumulated lots of oxygen at the start of this period. Therefore the emergence of eukaryotic cells coincided with the great oxidization event.</div>

            <div id="the-earths-history" class="essay" style="left:1420000px">The earth's history is kinda long.</div>

            <div id="paleozoic" class="essay" style="left:3302610px">Enter the Paleozoic era. Basically paleozoic comes from 2 Greek words: παλαιός (palaiós) meaning old and ζωή (zōḗ) life. So, to sum this period up, basically it was when we started having substansial signs of any life. </div>
            <div id="cambrian" class="event" style="margin-top:20px; left:3304972px"><span style="border-radius: 25px; width:15000px;" class="dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>The Cambrian Explosion </div>
            <div id="the-cambrian" class="essay" style="left:3360000px">The Cambrian Explosion (I prefer calling it the Biological Big Bang) happened in this period too. Basically life started becoming complex and actually interesting – now we have fricking animals, thank rapid genetic mutation and natural selection. Nobody REALLY knows why we had the Cambrian explosion, but people speculate with theories including changes in the environment, current ecology, etc, etc. </div>
            <div id="ordovician-silurian" class="event" style="left:3376308px"><span class="dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>Ordovician-Silurian extinction event </div>
            <div id="devonian" class="event" style="margin-top:20px; left:3401510px"><span style="border-radius: 25px; width:40000px;" class="dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>The Devonian Explosion </div>
            <div id="one-really-cool" class="essay" style="left:3410000px">One really cool eukaryotic life form that we’ve found fossilised evidence for is the trilobite. They’re the OG anthropods, invertibrate animals who have an exoskeleton, a segmented body, and pair jointed appendages. I reckon if they retained their form until today, people would have them as pets. I’d name mine Arthur, short for Arthuropod. Sadly most of them became extinct later on.</div>
            <div id="late-devonian" class="event" style="left:3450000px"><span class="dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>Late Devonian extinction </div>
            <div id="other-life-examples" class="essay" style="left:3460000px">Other life examples during this era include pretty flat looking fish (Cephalaspis), alien land plants (Cooksonia), and greater diversification of land animals during the Devonian period where certain types of fish evolved into the first tetropods. The Devonian explosion also occurred in this period, where plants decided to catch onto the evolutionary trend and evolve into trees, taller plants in general, and some hipster seeds. Problem was that this massive evolutionary explosion might’ve been the cause of the later Devonian mass extinction, you can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Devonian_extinction#Potential_causes.">here</a></div>
            <div id="it-should-be-noted" class="essay" style="left:3480000px">It should be noted that this era had much mountain building due to tectonic activity. Lots of this subduction happened around southern Australia causing the face of the Tasmania to have an acne outbreak.</div>
            <div id="the-paleozoic-era" class="essay" style="left:3500000px">The Paleozioc Era also happened to be when Gondwana started getting a move on. This was probably motivated by hipster intentions because the earth’s lands became cooler as a result, as it moved most of West Gondwana over the south pole. </div>
            <div id="the-end-of-the-devonian" class="essay" style="left:3520000px">The end of the Devonian period saw several consecutive mass extinctions because of a series of turnover pulses – major changes in climate. It meant that the earth lost most of its vertebrate life. I do hope that the Antropocene dosen’t end like this. </div>

            <div id="all-these-eras" class="essay" style="left:3530000px">All these eras and eons have some cool names right?</div>

            <div id="permian-triassic" class="event" style="left:3538500px"><span class="dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>Permian–Triassic extinction event </div>
            <div id="mesozoic" class="essay" style="left:3539090px">Enter the era of the dinosaurs, quite literally. This era housed all the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs you could ever want to make modern unrealistic movies about! </div>
            <div id="welcome-to-the" class="essay" style="left:3540723px">Welcome to the Triassic Period! It got off to a bad start, but as it progressed made progress in regenerating from the die-off at the start of it. It took several million years, but eventually we managed to evolve into the dinosaurs at the end of this period. Big things take time. </div>
            <div id="the-background-color" class="essay" style="left:3550000px">The background color for this era was inspired by the color of the rocks from this time period. Triassic rock is mainly sandstone, while Jurassic rock is predominantly limestone. The background color can be found in both rocks.</div>
            <div id="basically-this-age" class="essay" style="left:3560000px">Bascially this age enters with a mass extinction where over 90% of marine life died. Its called the “Great Dying” because its considered the biggest extinction event in the earth’s history. That’s natural processes for you.</div>
            <div id="essentially-the" class="essay" style="left:3570000px">Essentially the Mesozoic age means middle life μεσο (meso) which means between and ζῷον (zōon) which means biological life. It’s the era between the Paleozoic Era (Old life) and the Cenozoic era (New life), and is thus named accordingly. </div>
            <div id="triassic-jurassic" class="event" style="left:3578000px"><span class="dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>Triassic–Jurassic extinction event </div>
            <div id="now-we-enter" class="essay" style="left:3580000px">Now we enter the Jurassic period. Lets start examining this period by destroying the name choice of the movie Jurassic park. Jurassic comes from the word Jura which means wooded mountains. It’s an appropriate name for the period because the naturalist Alexander von Humboldt found geological evidence for this period in the Jura mountains on the France-Switzerland border. He thus named the period that the rocks came from Jurassic. Whereas the movie has no basis to name it Jurassic park as it is nothing about the GEOLOGY, but about the LIFE-FORMS from that period. Becides, there’s no reason to think that dinosaurs are only from the Jurassic period either. If you want to continue reading about how stupid Jurassic park is scientifically, you can read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs_in_Jurassic_Park#Scientific_accuracy">here</a> . </div>
            <div id="one-thing" class="essay" style="left:3620000px">One thing that I never got about dinosaurs was how their names are so hard to pronounce and history so hard to understand yet how many enthusiastic 3-5 year olds can lecture their high school siblings about each individual species.</div>
            <div id="the-last-period" class="essay" style="left:3624949px">The last period in this era is the cretaceous period. Basically this was the period of predator domination where dinosaurs were the apex predators on land and monosaurs were the apex predators in the sea. This food chain system continued to be dominant until a there was a mass extinction event that created the Chicxulub Crater, a small hole in the earth (depending on perspective). The mass-extinction event wiped out every animal over 10 kilos. Talk about body shaming.</div>

            <div id="cretaceous-paleogene" class="event" style="left:3688730px"><span class="dot"></span> <br> &uArr;<br>Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event </div>

            <div id="cenozoic" class="essay" style="left:3690220px">If the Paleozoic era was ancient greek for old life, and the Mesozoic era was ancient greek for middle life, can you guess what the Cenozoic is ancient greek for? You guessed it – New life! This final era houses today’s time. It houses today’s geology. It houses today’s life – us. </div>
            <div id="the-first-period" class="essay" style="left:3693300px">The first period of the Cenozoic era is Paleogene and started with the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and finished with the expansion of grass which saw the evolution of many animals that are here today – elephants, cats, dogs, etc. </div>
            <div id="the-cenozoic-era" class="essay" style="left:3710000px">The Cenozoic era was also the start of humans. It saw the first primates, and our evolution from them. Life started to get scarily intelligent. </div>
            <div id="the-second-period" class="essay" style="left:3723940px">The second period Neogene saw grass take up much of the world. This helped mammals to get bigger in size and number. Kelp forests also evolved. Despite being millions of years ago, this period’s life in view of the rest of the world can be called modern. The earth hasn’t decided to end the universe’s current fad – life that eats grass. How trendy. </div>
            <div id="th-background-color-for" class="essay" style="left:3730000px">The background color for this era is the color of a primate. Primates are what are most important about this era – they evolved into the the species to take the biggest affect on the earth in the shortest period of time ever yet.</div>
            <div id="the-most-recent" class="essay" style="left:3741065px">The most recent period in the earth’s history is the Quaternary. It is the period of dramatic changes in climate, it houses humans’ effect on the earth but also many ice ages. The evolution of life in this period was very drastic. Mammoths came and went. Giant ground sloths came and went. Humans came and stayed. Then impossibly, humans evolved to be intelligent, which is why you are reading this today. The earth decided to cede control of its own environment to humans. </div>
            <div id="welcome-to-the-present" class="essay" style="left:3746452px">Welcome to the present. Hopefully we won't die any time soon. Humanity has come a far way, but according to the doomsday clock (read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock">here</a>) there's only 100 seconds until midnight. We'll only continue to live if we can be respectful to our earth and each other. See the code <a href="https://github.com/frlegg/timeline">here</a></div>
